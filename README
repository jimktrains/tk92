tk92 is open source software designed for Radio Shack PRO-92
and PRO-2067 scanner radios.

I implemented tk92 in the Tcl/Tk scripting language which
enables it to run on a variety of operating systems,
including Linux, MacOS X, BSD, Solaris, Unix, Microsoft
Windows (95 and later), etc.

The free Tcl/Tk interpreter software must be installed
on your computer prior to using tk92.

Installation instructions may be found on the web at
http://parnass.org



                          Notes


The Linux version of tk92 presumes the wish windowing shell
is in your PATH.

Thanks to Ken Plotkin and Bill Petrowski for their initial
work documenting the memory image, and Steve Falco for
writing Linux command line cloning software.

Some of the Tcl/Tk procedures used in tk92 were devised by
other authors and their contributions are marked accordingly
within the source code.

Greg Shepherd, Ryan Schave, and Frank Monroe helped test tk92
on Windows.

COMPUTER INTERFACE ADAPTOR

Obtain the proper TTL-to-RS232 adapter for mating the
computer to the receiver.  Do not use a direct connect cable
because it will not work and could damage both the computer
and radio.

Use the Radio menu to identify which type of adapter cable
you have connected.

If your cable is not listed among the choices, try using
each choice until the program can read from the radio
and write to it successfully.

USAGE NOTES

In general, it's a good idea to connect the computer and radio
while the power to both is off.  It's inconvenient to turn the PC
off and on just to disconnect the radio so I use a serial port
switch box which connects my PC's serial port to one of four
devices and merely switch the radio in and out of the line.

If you are running Windows, you must reboot your PC
after downloading and installing the software on your computer,

When you first start the program, you will asked to identify
which serial port is connected to the radio. (If you ever
relocate the radio to a different serial port,
you should remove the tk92.ini file and restart tk92.
tk92 will recreate the tk92.ini file for you).

Once you've identified the proper serial port,
tk92 will open a couple of windows and display what
looks like a few forms.

Important: Before trying to reprogram your radio, you should first
read the image from your radio using the

Radio --> Read from radio...

menus and save it in a file using the

File --> Save As...

menus.  You can name it something like "original.spg".
Back up this file.

You can then export the memory channel information to
a .csv file, using the File --> Export memory channels menu.
Exit tk92.

You can use a text editor or spreadsheet
program to change or pretty-print the data in the .csv file.
Just be sure to write the data out in .csv format again.

You can restart tk92 and read the memory image file
(original.spg or whatever you named it) you created earlier,
using the File --> Open menus.

You can then view and change any of the settings.
If you have changed any of the memory channel data
in the .csv file, import it into tk92 using the
File --> Import memory channels menu.

You can check for errors in the data by using the
Data --> Validate menu.

If there are no errors, you should write the information
to a new image file (file name ends in .spg) using the
File --> Save As menu.

You can now program your radio using the
Radio --> Write to radio menu.

Note:  You cannot both read from and write to the radio
during the same tk92 session.




IMPORTING A FREQUENCY LIST FROM A .CSV FILE

Start the program.

Read in an image file (.spg extension) using

File -> Open

Import the memory channel information from
your .csv file using:

File -->  Import Memory Channels


Save the updated image in a new .spg file using
File --> Save As ...

Write the new image to the radio using

Radio --> Write to radio
